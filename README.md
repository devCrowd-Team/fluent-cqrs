Why fluent? Just look at this:

    public class AwsomeCommandHandler 
    {
      Aggregates _aggregates;
    
      public AwsomeCommandHandler(Aggregates aggregates)
      {
        _aggregates = aggregates;
      }
      
      public void Handle(SuperDuperCommand command)
      {
        _aggregates
          .Provide<[AnAggregateYouLike]>
          .With(command.AggregateId)
          .Do(yourAggregate => yourAggregate.DoSomethingWith(command.Data));

		  // You want it with exception handling?
		  // Lets do it

		  _aggregates
			   .Provide<[AnAggregateYouLike]>
			   .With(command.AggregateId)
			   .Try(yourAggregate => yourAggregate.DoSomethingWith(command.Data))
			   .CatchException(exception=> handleThis(exception));

      }
    }

Uhhh... this is the *complete handling* of a Domain Command.

Ok, but what do I have to do to **publish** the new state, aka **Domain Events**?

This is simple. You assign any Event Handler you like by chaining it by the `And` method after `PublishNewStateTo`. For example you have three Event Handlers:

    var _aggregates = Aggregates.CreateWith(yourExtremeGoodEventStoreInstance);
    
    var firstEventHandler = new SampleEventHandler();
    var secondEventHandler = new ReportingHandler();
    var thirdEventHandler = new LoggingHandler();

    _aggregates
      .PublishNewStateTo(firstEventHandler)
      .And(secondEventHandler)
      .And(thirdEventHandler);
    
now all your cool Event Handlers receiving all changes of an aggregate.

All right... In some cases you want to save an event only once, but if you add the event into the list of Changes like this: 

    class CoolAggregate() : Aggregate
    {
        ...
        public void DoSomethingHelpful()
        {
            Changes.Add(new SomethingHappend());
        }
        ...
    }

the event will save everytime. Bad, very bad. Here comes the hero 'Replay' ...

    class CoolAggregate() : Aggregate
    {
        ...
        public void DoSomethingHelpful()
        {
            if(MessagesOfType<SomethingHappend>().Any)
            {
                Replay(new SomethingHappend());
            }
           else
           {
               Changes.Add(new SomethingHappend());
           }
        }
        ...
    }

The `Replay` method prevents you for multiple equals events.
